# Qxi

A roblox hack client that I just started. I will be working on this client!

-----------------

# Usage

* Go to the loadstring file and copy it then paste it into executor

-----------------
# DEVLOGS

* Since roblox is deleting gotham and arial fonts i decided to add a font table to Qxi

```lua

local guilibrary = { font = Enum.Font.Arial }

```
* Added reloading for roblox studio
```lua


local guilibrary = loadstring(game:HttpGet("raw.github.com/resurvenge/Qxi/master/guilibrary.lua", true))();

_G.reload = function()
            -- IMPORT ALL OF THE CODE YOU WANT TO RELOAD

             return loadQiex(); -- MUST BE AT THE END
 end

```
